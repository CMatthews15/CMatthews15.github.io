# BudgetTracker

in attempt 1 I practiced psudocoding and tried to reach an end result on my own.
I was able to make the amounts function properly but was unable to get the descriptions to coopoerate and decided to use online resources to start over with a different approach. 

replanning my approach was successful and allowed me to create a functional budget tracker that can be found included.
