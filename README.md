# BudgetTracker

in attempt 1 I practiced psudocoding and rried to reach an end reslut on my own.
I was able to make the amounts function properly but was unable to get the descriptions to coopoerate and decide to use online resources to start over with a different approach. 

replanning my approach was successful and allowed me to create a functional budget track that can be found in the file budget.
